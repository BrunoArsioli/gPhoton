	targetid
		type: str
		desc: The ID for this target.  Can be supplied by the 
		user.  If not, target is assigned to "Target_<nn>" where
		<nn> is a zero-padded number with a length equal to the
		length of the total number of targets.  For example, 
		"01" if there are 10-99 targets, "001" if there are 
		100-999 targets, etc.

	ra
		type: float
		desc: The Right Ascension (in degrees) for the target.

	dec
		type: float
		desc: The Declination (in degrees) for the target.

	glon
		type: float
		desc: The galactic longitude (in degrees) for the 
		target.

	glat
		type: float
		desc: The galactic lattitude (in degrees) for the 
		target.

	fuv_tot_exptime
		type: float
		desc: The total FUV time (in seconds) across all slices
		      from the gFind command.

	nuv_tot_exptime
		type: float
		desc: The total NUV time (in seconds) across all slices
		      from the gFind command.

	fuv_timerange_start
		type: float
		desc: The start of the FUV data (in GALEX time) across 
		      all slices from the gFind command.

	fuv_timerange_end
		type: float
		desc: The end of the FUV data (in GALEX time) across 
		      all slices from the gFind command.

	nuv_timerange_start
		type: float
		desc: The start of the NUV data (in GALEX time) across 
		      all slices from the gFind command.

	nuv_timerange_end
		type: float
		desc: The end of the NUV data (in GALEX time) across 
		      all slices from the gFind command.

	fuv_start_stop
		type: list
		desc: The start and stop times for each contiguous slice
		      of available FUV data.  Each slice is represented
		      as a list containing [start_galex, end_galex, 
		      start_bjd, end_bjd, start_cal, end_cal, total], 
		      where "galex" is in GALEX time system, "bjd" is in
		      barycentric Julian date, "cal" is in Unix UTC, and
		      total is the total time in this slice measured in 
		      seconds.  GALEX and BJD times are floats, Unix UTC
		      times are strings, and the total exposure time is
		      a float.

	nuv_start_stop
		type: list
		desc: The start and stop times for each contiguous slice
		      of available NUV data.  Each slice is represented
		      as a list containing [start_galex, end_galex, 
		      start_bjd, end_bjd, start_cal, end_cal, total], 
		      where "galex" is in GALEX time system, "bjd" is in
		      barycentric Julian date, "cal" is in Unix UTC, and
		      total is the total time in this slice measured in 
		      seconds.  GALEX and BJD times are floats, Unix UTC
		      times are strings, and the total exposure time is
		      a float.

		desc: Full path and file name of the most recent FUV 
		time lapse movie.

		type: list
		desc: Set of FUV images at specified time intervals, 
		      each represented as a list containing 
		      [path_to_image, image_timestamp, image_exptime], 
		      where "path_to_image" is the full path and file 
		      name of this album image, "image_timestamp" is the
		      timestamp of the album image in Unix UTC, and 
		      "image_exptime" is the actual exposure time used 
		      to create this album image.

	nuv_time_series_album
		type: list
		desc: Set of NUV images at specified time intervals, 
		      each represented as a list containing

		      where "path_to_image" is the full path and file 
		      name of this album image, "image_timestamp" is the
		      timestamp of the album image in Unix UTC, and 
		      "image_exptime" is the actual exposure time used
