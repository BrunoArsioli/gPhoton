#NOTICE OF SERVICE INTERRUPTION: The web servers at STScI will be undergoing maintenance from Friday, 21 August, 2015  6:00 PM to  Saturday, 22 August, 2015  1:00 AM. The gPhoton web server may not be available for all or some of this period. Ongoing jobs may fail as a result. We suggest that users wait until Sunday to start new large jobs.

**gPhoton** is a project to calibrate, archive, and make available every photon event observed by the GALEX mission in an effort to dramatically improve the flexibility and utility of the data with specific emphasis on enabling short time domain photometric studies.

To get started, please read the [User Guide](https://github.com/cmillion/gPhoton/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md).

#####Database Status
**Every photon observed through GR6/7 is now available in the database!** This includes every observation up to the start of the post-NASA or "CAUSE" phase of the mission.
