**gPhoton** is a project to calibrated, archive, and make available every photon event observed by the GALEX mission in an effort to dramatically improve the flexibility and utility of the data with specific emphasis on enabling short time domain photometric studies.

In addition to the source code contained in this repository, you will need the calibration files and (optionally) a directory of sample data which can be downloaded from MAST at _[link TBD]_.
