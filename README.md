**gPhoton** is a project to calibrate, archive, and make available every photon event observed by the GALEX mission in an effort to dramatically improve the flexibility and utility of the data with specific emphasis on enabling short time domain photometric studies.

To get started, please read the [User Guide](https://github.com/cmillion/gPhoton/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md).

#####Database Status
The database is still being populated with GALEX data. It currently contains ~5% of the GR6/7 corpus. The tile-by-tile coverage of the current database can be found [here](https://github.com/cmillion/gPhoton/blob/master/docs/coaddList_061714.csv) and [here](https://github.com/cmillion/gPhoton/blob/master/docs/visitList_061714.csv).

The database will be updated in chunks delineated by sky regions numbered 1 to 10, starting with 10 and going backwards. The first region ("DB10") will cover all data from above 52.5 degrees in declination. A graph of the delinations of each region is available [here](https://github.com/cmillion/gPhoton/blob/master/docs/database/dbs_forpaper.png).
