CAUSE Phase
\b0 \
	NASA support for the mission ended in February of 2011. At that time, ownership of the spacecraft was transferred to the California Institute of Technology for a mission phase called the \'93Complete the All-sky UV Survey Extension\'94 (CAUSE), during which operating costs were solicited from individuals or institutions and detector field and source brightness were relaxed, enabling substantial additional observations of bright regions of the sky not observable during the primary mission, and spacecraft slew rate limits were also relaxed, permitting a new high coverage \'93scan mode\'94 of observation that swept across several degrees of sky in a single integration. Ownership of the CAUSE-phase data resides with the indivudual observation sponsers, and only a small fraction of it has been made available to MAST [citation]. Though the new capabilities of the gPhoton project and its attendant tools may be of particular value in using and interpreting CAUSE phase data \'97 in particular scan mode observations or observations of very bright or dense fields \'97 the current paper describes work only with data up through the end of the NASA supported mission, corresponding to General Release (GR) 7 of the GALEX data to the MAST archive, and only observations collected in the direct imaging mode. Future work may address both scan mode and spectroscopic data.}
