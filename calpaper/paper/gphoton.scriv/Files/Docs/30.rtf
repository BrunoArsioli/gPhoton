\b0 \
We describe gPhoton, which enables more flexible analysis of GALEX ultraviolet data, including high time resolution photometric analyses, by sky projecting and hosting approximately 1.1 trillion individual photon events and providing a tool set for generating calibrated light curves and images with a large large number of user-definable parameters. The project includes a standalone, pure-Python calibration pipeline that reproduces core functionality of the original mission pipeline, an approximately 130 Tb publicly accessible database of photon level data hosted by the Mikulski Archive at Space Telescope, and command line tools to enable reuction and use of the photon data for common classes of analyses, including the creation of calibrated light curves of individual sources or calibrated images and movies of sourcs and fields. The gPhoton software and source code are publicly available under a permissive license and will continue to be developed and maintained in the future. We describe the motivation, design, and implementation of the calibration pipeline, database, and tools, with emphasize on divergence from the mission pipeline and challenges of working with large volumes of photon-level data. We also highlight, with examples, new types of scientific investigation made possible by this project.}
