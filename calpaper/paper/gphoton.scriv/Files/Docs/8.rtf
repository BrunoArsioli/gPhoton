\f0\fs28 \cf0 Microchannel plates (MCP) are non-integrating detectors. That is, rather than accumulating a running total of incident photons (\'93events\'94) into a sort of two dimensional histogram of the field brightness, MCPs record position and time for every individual event. The GALEX detectors were capable of recording events with a time resolution down to [something], with a default time resolution for almost all observations of five thousandths of a second. Due primarily to total data volume, concerns, however, the mission team only released the data as images or 
\i maps
\i0  with integrated depths of hundreds to thousands of a second \'97 except on a small number of occasions by special request. This was more than adequate to meet the scientific objectives of the mission, and, indeed, has created an extremely rich and valuable data resource for the community. Much recent work \'97 including what we describe herein \'97 has demonstrated that many sources in the sky are varying quite dramatically in the ultraviolet on scales of seconds to minutes, however, and the opportunity to investigate such sources with GALEX was lost by the prior archiving schema.}
