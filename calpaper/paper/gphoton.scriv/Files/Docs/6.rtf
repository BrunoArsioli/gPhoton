\f0\fs28 \cf0 Within the misison pipeline, the detector flat was projected into the sky according to the spacecraft aspect solution and then integrated and interpolated into a high resolution relative response (rrhr) map which could then be applied to the integrated count maps to correct for detector response and effective exposure (as a function of sky position), as well as any static or dynamic masking (of hotspots, ghosts, or edge reflections). The gPhoton pipeline, instead, applies the detector flat at the detector level by 
\i weighting
\i0  each individual photon event by the value of the flat at the detector location upon which it fell.}
