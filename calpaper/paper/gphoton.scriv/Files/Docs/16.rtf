\f0\b\fs28 \cf0 gAperture
\b0 \
gAperture extracts and calibrates event level data from the database to produce photometry and light curves given a host of user-specified parameters including target position, extraction aperture, background annulus, integration depth, and time ranges. Rather than performing photometric measurements on pixelized and integrated images, as the mission pipeline did, gAperture conducts cone searches on the sky positions of individual photon events for the purposes of aperture photometry and background subtraction, allowing analysis at the native spatial resolution of the data. Each photon event so selected is then weighted by the detector flat value at the spot on the detector on which it occurred, using the mission-produced flats. All events within a given observation (or \'93time bin\'94) are then weighted by the effective exposure time.}
