    # "skypos" is set to the refined coordinates to account for large

    # "stepsz" gives the light curve 10-second sampling (10-second bins)
    # "csvfile" is the name of the output light curve file
    # "maxgap" defines the maximum gap between what are to be considered
    # separate observing sequences
    # "radius" sets the photometric aperture size, in degrees!
    # "annulus" sets the inner and outer annuli for background subtraction,
    # in degrees!
    # "detsize" makes sure that all available photon events are included, even
    # those near the edge of the detector
