CHASE
-----
- Update paper text to describe the new MCAT background method in paper.

- Update paper text to describe new way of extracting sources for dMag vs. Mag plots in paper, and also update the figures.

- Replace all pickle files with plain text (csv) files.

- Update the example scripts to use the new queries that include "leg" and "obstype".

- Add simple example of gPipeline() to Table 2, and double check the others that they would work for those install with pip (I can't run pip install without removing my GitHub install).

- Add more description about the single-photon retrieval capabilities somewhere in Section 4, probably as a paragraph at the end of Section 4.1 where we describe gPipeline?

- Add a description in the UserGuide that explains how to filter on leg.  Add a sentence in Section 5.4 that redirects the reader to that specific section of the UserGuide.


EITHER
------
- Investigate how to handle leap seconds in GALEX time, and when doing conversions (conversions might be handled automatically with astropy).

- Add option to return individual photon events to a separate CSV file when calling gAperture from a command line (and not as a module).  A ticket has been filed for this on github.  Also add section on saving the individual photon events to a file in the UserGuide.


SCOTT
-----
- Make plot showing the first outliers of the delta Mag vs Mag plots are due to contaminating sources in the apertures, and show the agreement is better with refined apertures.  Will need to work with Chase on sending a list of the worst outliers.
