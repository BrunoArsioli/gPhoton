-----
- Update paper text to describe the new MCAT background method in paper. -- DONE

- Update paper text to describe new way of extracting sources for dMag vs. Mag plots in paper, and also update the figures. -- DONE

- Replace all pickle files with plain text (csv) files. -- DONE

- Update the example scripts to use the new queries that include "leg" and "obstype". -- DONE

- Add simple example of gPipeline() to Table 2, and double check the others that they would work for those install with pip (I can't run pip install without removing my GitHub install). -- DONE

- Add more description about the single-photon retrieval capabilities somewhere in Section 4, probably as a paragraph at the end of Section 4.1 where we describe gPipeline? -- DONE

- Add a description in the UserGuide that explains how to filter on leg.  Add a sentence in Section 5.4 that redirects the reader to that specific section of the UserGuide. -- DONE


EITHER
------
- Investigate how to handle leap seconds in GALEX time, and when doing conversions (conversions might be handled automatically with astropy). -- DONE (We're not handling them.)

- Add option to return individual photon events to a separate CSV file when calling gAperture from a command line (and not as a module).  A ticket has been filed for this on github.  Also add section on saving the individual photon events to a file in the UserGuide. -- DONE

- Make sure any of the *methods* in the code examples and paper itself have their names and import syntax updated to reflect lowercase method names. -- DONE (sort of)

- UserGuide needs to be swept and changed syntax for all-lowercase main methods now. -- DONE (sort of)

- Need to add a note to gAperture in UserGuide about photoncsvfile option and emphasize how important/useful it can be. -- DONE


SCOTT
-----
- Make plot showing the first outliers of the delta Mag vs Mag plots are due to contaminating sources in the apertures, and show the agreement is better with refined apertures.  Will need to work with Chase on sending a list of the worst outliers.

- Make sure if any of the CR Dra files are still being provided outside the document itself that they match the new commands in the paper itself.

- Re-make Fig. 12 showing aperture to be based on a 10-sec image cube frame, include spatial scale, intensity stretch, etc.

- Re-make Fig. 13 showing flares with new aperture based on image cube and making sure to avoid detector edges like the example does.

- Make a version of gphoton.tex that uses emulateapj in 2-column format right before submission to make sure things look good still.  Use this one when posting to astro-ph.
