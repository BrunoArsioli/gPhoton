\f0\fs26 \cf0 Prior GALEX documentation has suggested that users of the photon-level data assume that the observation-level exposure time is distributed evenly across the whole observaiton. This assumption, though, is not true, and sometimes quite significantly so. Not only can shutter be distributed non-linearly over an observation, but the global count rate can change quite substantially even over an observation of a single target because the detector is constantly moving on the sky (causing small changes in the global count rate due to the field brightness) at the same time as the spacecraft is travelling through the shadow of the Earth, creating global brightness shifts due to airglow. If one plots global count rates as a function of time for a typical ~1600 MIS observation, there will be a characteristic \'93smile\'94 shape; this shape is inverted (a \'93frown\'94) in a plot of effective exposure as a function of time (because higher global count rates crate more detector deadtime, resulting in less effective exposure time). Researchers interested in the variability of targets within single observations should recompute the exposure time for every sub-integration (\'93bin\'94) in order to account for this bias.}
