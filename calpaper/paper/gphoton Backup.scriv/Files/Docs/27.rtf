\'93Course Sun Point\'94
\b0 \
	The FUV detector failed in May of 2009. On 4 May 2010, an event referred to by the mission team as \'93the Course Sun Point anomaly\'94 (or CSP, referring to the safe mode entered by the spacecraft at that time) resulted in image degredation of the NUV detector, manifest as severe streaking in the detector Y-direction, most probably due to a failed capacitor. Although the effect was largely corrected through subsequent calibration and onboard adjustments [CITE], observations taken between 4 May and 23 June 2010 have substantially worse point spread functions.}
