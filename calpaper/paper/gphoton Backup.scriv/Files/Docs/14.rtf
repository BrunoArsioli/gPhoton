gFind
\i0  is a search tool that provides a mechanism for the user to query the available in-database coverage depth (if any) of a particular target. Given a target position, gFind returns the estimated (raw) exposure depth of available data over the whole mission, broken down into time ranges corresponding roughly to discrete observations of the target. Rather than using the visit-based bookkeeping of the mission \'97 which distinguished between observation modes and survey type \'97 gFind attempts to use the data itself. A given position on the sky is considered to likely be \'93observed\'94 if valid data exists in a time range where the position falls within one FOV (or user-defined effective FOV) radius of the spacecraft boresight as given by the mission-provided refined aspect solution. Distinct time ranges are identified based on a user-adjustable parameter that defines the maximum allowable gap between events for data to be considered contiguous (i.e part of the same observation); this parameter defaults to 1 second, the time resolution of the aspect solutions. A separate user-adjustable parameter sets the minimum exposure depth required for a time range considered to be a \'93valid\'94 exposure at all (below which threshhold it is not reported).}
