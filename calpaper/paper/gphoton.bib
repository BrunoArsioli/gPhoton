abstract     = {<p>Zones index an N-dimensional Euclidian or metric space to efficiently support
                points-near-a-point queries either within a dataset or between two datasets. The
                approach uses relational algebra and the B-Tree mechanism found in almost all
                relational database systems. Hence, the Zones Algorithm gives a
                portable-relational implementation of points-near-point, spatial cross-match, and
                self-match queries. This article corrects some mistakes in an earlier article we
                wrote on the Zones Algorithm and describes some algorithmic improvements. The
                Appendix includes an implementation of point-near-point, self-match, and
                cross-match using the USGS city and stream gauge database.</p>},
