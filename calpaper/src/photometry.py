# The canonical GALEX pipeline used the Source Extractor (SExtractor) toolkit
#  to extract photometric information from images. gAperture uses naive aperture
#  photometry. These methods needs to be compared. The most straightforward way
#  to do this is to compare gAperture flux measurements to their corresponding
#  MCAT or GCAT values for a large number of sources across the sky. Do this
#  efficiently will require enhancement of gAperture with the capability to
#  determine and automatically use "optimum" aperture parameters based upon the
#  MCAT/GCAT entry for the target in question.
